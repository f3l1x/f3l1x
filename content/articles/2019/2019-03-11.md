What was our plan for 2018 in Contributte organization.

<!--more-->

<p class="alert alert-warning">This blogpost just summarized some points of year 2018 for Contributte organization. Originally <a href="https://github.com/contributte/contributte/issues/3">published on Github</a> issue.</p>

This is roadmap for 2018 for Contributte ecosystem, *from my point of view*.

## Finalize

Transform to contributte (composer, namespace, codesniffer, PHP 7.1):

- https://github.com/contributte/dummy-events
- https://github.com/contributte/social
- https://github.com/contributte/deployer-extension
- https://github.com/contributte/mobilni-platby
- https://github.com/contributte/nextras-orm-query-object
- https://github.com/contributte/image-storage
- https://github.com/contributte/api-router
- https://github.com/contributte/api-docu
- https://github.com/contributte/anabelle

## PSR

Create PSR-based repositories for Nette/Contributte applications:

- https://github.com/contributte/psr7-http-message
- https://github.com/contributte/psr11-container-interface
- https://github.com/contributte/psr6-caching
- https://github.com/contributte/psr3-logging

## New packages

We still have been missing some tiny integrations of:

- Monolog
- Redis
- Facebook
- Symfony Validator
- Symfony Translator
- Google

These packages have their implementations in Kdyby ([Validator](https://github.com/Kdyby/Validator), [Monolog](https://github.com/Kdyby/Monolog), etc..). But Kdyby has unsure/unpredictable future and Kdyby's integrations are little bit fat (my feelings only).

## Acquisitions

### Ublaboo

We've been working with [@paveljanda](https://github.com/paveljanda) on big top-secret project about contributte and ublaboo. First swallow you could notice in [contributte/application repository](https://github.com/contributte/application/pull/12).

### Arachne

We've been working with [@mabar](https://github.com/mabar) / [@enumag](https://github.com/enumag) on back-porting [Arachne](https://github.com/arachne) into [Contributte](https://github.com/contributte).
See more in special issue, [#2](https://github.com/contributte/contributte/issues/2), for that transfer.

## Cleanup

I'm not quite sure how to deal with some empty repositories. There're some good ideas and thoughts, but I don't have enough time. Maybe others? We'll see.

- https://github.com/contributte/model
- https://github.com/contributte/routing
- https://github.com/contributte/symfonier [REMOVED]
- https://github.com/contributte/nextras-criteria

Thank you guys for being in Contributte and try to do your best. Some of them improve 1 repository, some improve more then one.

# Website

Contributte is not a small project, we need a website. I would like to create something similar to this website (https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/installation.html), I like the schema/layout a lot.

We'll probably use Hugo as static generator, unless there'll a be big mind-changer in usage.

The game-changer in static sites generators is Vuepress (https://vuepress.vuejs.org/), looks simple and powerful. But I'm not sure how to handle multi-repo documentation.

We need to discuss it deeper.

# Playground

In Contributte we have the main goal to show **stable and working packages** to others, thus we are building our [**playground**](https://github.com/contributte/playground).

For now, there is just API example, which is quite old and contributte/api has been transformed into Apitte anyway. Latest example of working API is in [apitte/playgroud](https://github.com/apitte/playground).

We need to focus more on `playground`, examples and tutorials to spread our packages. Don't you think guys? Sure, you do.

Let's create some examples:

- contributte/console
- contributte/event-dispatcher
- contributte/middlewares
- contributte/forms + recaptcha
- and many others...

# Ideas

I am still active in Java development and there's a cool feature called **monads**. I would like to have someting similar in Contributte.

Some articles:
